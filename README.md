<h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<h3> I'm Maria Julia, but you can call me Maju! </h3>

As soon as I left high school, I started to dedicate myself to communication and PR, but after 3 years at college and working for technology companies as a PR, I decided to follow a new path and learn how to develop, and now I am a programer!
 
You can follow my studies through my [mentorship repository](https://github.com/azraelgarden/maju-mentoria) accompanied by my mentor [Azrael Garden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/azrael-garden/).

Currently, the technology that I am most interested in and use the most is React <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/48d099290b4cb2d7937bcd96e8497cf1845b54a810a6432c70cf944b60b40c77/68747470733a2f2f7261776769742e636f6d2f676f72616e67616a69632f72656163742d69636f6e732f6d61737465722f72656163742d69636f6e732e737667" width="20px"/>
