<h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<h3> I'm Maria Julia, but you can call me Maju! </h3>

<p>As soon as I left high school, I started to dedicate myself to communication and PR, but after 3 years at college and 2.5 years working for technology companies as a PR, I decided to follow a new path and learn how to develop. And now I am a Web developer!</p>

<p> Currently, I am working as a Process Hacker/Software Engineer at Centauro! </p>
  
<p> The technologies that I'm using are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJs, PostgreSQL, and I'm studying React, React Native and others </p>

<h4> Well, that's me! Hope you like my projects &#128151; </h4>
