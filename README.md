<h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<h3> I'm Maria Julia, but you can call me Maju! </h3>

<p>For 3 years of my life I dedicated myself to communication and PR, but after 2 years working for technology companies as a PR, I decided to follow a new path and learn how to develop. My goal is to be a #FRONTEND developer!</p>

<p>Currently, I am dedicating myself to two awesome online courses, <a href="https://rocketseat.com.br/launchbase"> Launchbase </a> from Rocketseat, and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/web-completo/">Complete Web Development 2020 </a> from Udemy.</p>
<p> I am studying HTML5, CSS3, , JavaScript, BootStrap 4, Node.js, PostgreSQL and MySQL, but focusing more on the fisrt four,  and I am using Nunjucks as template engine for most of my works. </p>
<p> Also, I am looking for my first job in technology,  so that I can learn more and more, and put my knowledge into practice! </p>

<h4> Well, that's me! Hope you like my projects &#128151; </h4>
